## 📚 What's Inside

This repository is a structured learning path through Python, organized across **3 progressive notebooks**:

### 📓 Python Essentials 1 — Foundations
> *The building blocks of Python programming*

- Jupyter Notebook overview & workflow
- Variables, Data Types, and Type Casting
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and Loop Control (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- Functions — defining, calling, arguments, return values
- String Manipulation and Formatting

---

### 📓 Python Essentials 2 — Intermediate Concepts
> *Going deeper with Python's core capabilities*

- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- List Comprehensions & Generator Expressions
- File Handling — reading, writing, appending
- Exception Handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`)
- Modules & Packages — importing, creating
- Lambda Functions, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Iterators and Generators

---

### 📓 Python Essentials 3 — Advanced & Applied
> *Real-world Python for data and design*

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
  - Magic / Dunder Methods
- **NumPy** — array operations, broadcasting, indexing
- **Pandas** — DataFrames, data cleaning, groupby
- **Data Visualization** — Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Time Series Analysis**
  - DateTime handling with Pandas
  - Resampling, Rolling Windows
  - Trend & Seasonality decomposition
